# Crap-Writer
You're on deadline with a city council story, you have six calls to return for a long-tail investigative piece due Friday, and then your idiot editor adds a crappy parade story to your pile? You need this steaming lump of trite crap written, and you need it quick! Good thing you have Crap Writer. All you have to do is tell it what kind of stupid, hackneyed space-filler story your dumb bosses are making you write, fill in a few blanks, and Crap Writer will write the story for you! Don't worry, it won't suck any worse than it would have if you'd written it from scratch. Enjoy!
